We have a functioning basic sugarscape model with one type of agent (prey) and sugar regrowth according to a spatial Poisson process.
We have also witten classes for prey and population, but for now they are unused.

The current plan is to simulate a road by setting the sugar content of a number of adjecent columns to -1. This makes it easy to spot the
road in the rest of the code, and also makes sure that agents will not want to cross it.

Might change roads to -2 sugar content and add tunnels with -1 sugar content, to differentiate between them. Bridges could in principle
have food growing on them, so setting their sugar content to zero and barring any tiles with negative sugar content from growing
new sugar should give the desired behavior. 
Simplification: if an agent can see sugar on the other side of the road, and ALSO a path to cross the road (tunnel/bridge), 
it will automatically reach the sugar.

Reproduction will be added simply as a probability that any living agent can spawn a new agent in each round.

Final note: Basic reproduction has been added, but tunnels/bridges are not finished yet.

There might be a bug in our position initialization, as the initial agents spawn on the road despite our attempts to confine them
to only one side of the board.
