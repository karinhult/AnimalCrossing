Where we're at:
- We have implemented the road, and the animals cannot cross it
- Classes works
- Reproduction works, except from road births
- Implemented so that a simple parameter determines if there is a road
- Implemented so that a simple parameter determines if the animals are on one or both sides of the road, also it seems animals can cross atm?

Future plan:
- Implement so that a simple parameter determines if there are crossings
- Make sure crossings work - meaning that the animals can cross the road if there is a crossing, and they can stand on the crossing but not on the road
- Start simulating
  - Simulate x times without road and take average of number of dead animals
  - Simulate x times with road and take average of number of dead animals
  - Simulate x times with road and crossings and take average of number of dead animals
  - Repeat last step with different constellationsof crossings
    - Determine how many bridges/tunnels gives how many deaths
    - Determine how many tunnels gives the same result as y bridges
- Add predators
